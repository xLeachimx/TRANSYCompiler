beginning:
C* This is all setup for later
C* Mostly data entry
dim array[100]
lwrite "Enter the number of items you wish to enter(less than 100):"
read size
lwrite "Enter elements into the array."
if(size=1)then output
ifa(size)output,output,input

input:
size = size-1
loop i=0,size,1
	C* stupid prompting
	lwrite "This is the "
	temp = i+1
	write temp
	lwrite " out of "
	temp = size + 1
	write temp
	lwrite " element:"
	aread array,i,i
loop-end
cls

C* Now for the inefficent sort
C* Ok I'll be honest it is a bubble sort
sort: offset = 1
fullSize = size + 1
loop i=0,fullSize,1
	cdump 0, 20
	end = size - offset
	loop j=0,end,1
		comp1 = array[j]
		comp2 = array[j+1]
		if(comp1 <= comp2) then skip
		temp = array[j]
		array[j] = array[j+1]
		array[j+1] = temp
		skip:
	loop-end
	ifa(end)error,output,continue
	continue:offset = offset + 1
loop-end

output:
cls
lwrite "The sorted contents"
awrite array,0,size
lwrite "Make me say something"
lread $someth1ng
lwrite $someth1ng

listo
